# Changelog

All notable changes to the plugin are recorded here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-29

- Much faster cleanup of old snapshot history. The old cleanup query could run for many minutes
  (or effectively never finish) on a table of millions of rows; the new one does a 4-million-row
  cleanup in about 20 seconds, keeping exactly the same rows. The cleanup also now has a 10-minute
  time limit instead of 30 seconds.
- New recommended index for the daily cleanup: `sql/003_snapshot_timestamp_index.sql`.
- The default retention window is now 2 months (was 6). Existing installs keep whatever they have
  saved; change it in the settings window. Long-term history is kept in the metric history table.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-29

First tracked version. Everything the plugin does so far:

- Syncs characters, retainers, submarines, inventory, Free Company chests and housing data
  (from AutoRetainer, AllaganTools and FCTracker) into Postgres on a configurable interval.
- Postgres credentials kept in Windows Credential Manager, with separate local and remote
  entries; an unreadable credential is now logged instead of failing silently.
- Daily retention and downsampling of the character snapshot history.
- Metric history for charts: gil, ceruleum, repair kits, FC points (associated with the FC
  leader) and salvage item quantities, stored only when they change
  (`sql/001_metric_history.sql`, optional backfill in `sql/002_...`).
- The version is shown in the main and settings window titles, in the plugin installer, and in
  the log on load.
